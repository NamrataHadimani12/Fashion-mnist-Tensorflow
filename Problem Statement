BUILDING USING LOW LEVEL API AND TENSORFLOW


The Fashion - MNIST dataset is a basic image dataset consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a 
test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image (784 pixel values in total), associated 
with a label from 10 different classes. The following are the set of classes i n this classification problem 
( the associated integer class label is listed in brackets ) . 
• T - shirt/top (0) 
• Trouser (1)
• Pullover (2)
• Dress (3) 
• Coat (4) 
• Sandal (5) 
• Shirt (6) 
• Sneaker (7) 
• Bag (8)
• Ankle boot (9)

 In this code the class labels are one hot encoded. For example, the final shape of t he matrix that contains the training class labels is ( 10, 60000 ).

You will notice that this code will print out the shape of the training and test data for both features and labels as follows: 
         Shape of training features (60000, 784) 
         Shape of test features (10000, 784) 
         Shape of training labels (10, 60000) 
         Shape of testing labels (10, 10000) 

NOTE : Depending on how you implement your solution you may want to change the shape of the above matrices.
